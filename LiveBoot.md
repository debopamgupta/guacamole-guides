# Live Boot / Install Ubuntu

1.  Get Ubuntu LTS ISO https://ubuntu.com/#download
2.  Get a USB stick ( at least 4 GB ) _Warning: Make sure you dont care about the files on the USB as it willl be formatted completely, any data on there will be lost_
3.  Download Rufus / Balena Etcher on a host computer. (https://rufus.ie/en/# https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
4.  Run Rufus on the USB stick ( mostly it will only choose the removable medias so its safe).
5.  Flash the ISO onto the USB with Rufus. Keep all defaults - MBR, UEFI/BIOS etc
6.  Reboot.

_Your Computer should get to install from USB , alternatively, select that manually in the boot menu, by changing the order of boot devices. ( press F12 or F2 or Esc while booting up to access the BIOS)_

6.  And then select `try ubuntu` from the installer or install ubuntu if you want so.
